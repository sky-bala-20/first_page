                Tiger
            </h2>
            <p>
                The tiger (Panthera tigris) stands as the largest and most iconic big cat, characterized by its vibrant orange fur adorned with bold black stripes. Found across diverse habitats in Asia, from dense jungles to icy landscapes, this solitary predator is a symbol of strength and agility. Adult males can weigh between 400 to 600 pounds, with the Siberian tiger claiming the title of the largest subspecies. Tigers are carnivores, relying on their powerful build and keen senses for stealthy hunting. Despite their solitary nature, they are proficient swimmers. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect these majestic cats from threats like habitat loss and poaching.

            <p>
                The zebra, a striking herbivorous mammal, is known for its distinctive black-and-white striped coat. Belonging to the horse family, Equidae, zebras are native to Africa and are particularly prevalent on the grasslands and savannas. These unique stripes are thought to serve as a form of camouflage and may also play a role in social interactions within their herds. Zebras are social animals, often forming groups for protection against predators like lions. With excellent stamina and agility, zebras are capable runners and can reach impressive speeds when threatened. Their fascinating appearance and behaviors make zebras a captivating and iconic species in the animal kingdom.

                Elephants, the largest land animals, are remarkable mammals known for their intelligence, social behavior, and iconic trunks. Found in Africa and Asia, elephants exhibit strong family bonds, living in matriarchal herds led by the oldest female. Their distinctive trunks, a fusion of the upper lip and nose, serve multiple functions, from grasping objects to trumpeting communication. Elephants are herbivores, consuming a variety of plants and vegetation. With an exceptional memory, they navigate extensive territories in search of food and water. Unfortunately, elephants face threats such as habitat loss and poaching, making conservation efforts crucial for the survival of these gentle giants.

            <p>
                Snakes are elongated, legless, carnivorous reptiles that can be found on every continent except Antarctica. They evolved from a four-legged reptilian ancestor about 100 million years ago. There are approximately 3,600 species of snakes, and they come in a wide range of sizes, from the tiny thread snake, which is only 4 inches long, to the reticulated python, which can grow up to 30 feet long. Snakes are known for their unique ability to swallow prey whole, and they have a flexible jaw that allows them to eat animals much larger than their head.
